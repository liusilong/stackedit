 An area of a [Material] that responds to touch. Has a configurable shape and
 can be configured to clip splashes that extend outside its bounds or not.

 For a variant of this widget that is specialized for rectangular areas that
 always clip splashes, see [InkWell].

 An [InkResponse] widget does two things when responding to a tap:

  * It starts to animate a _highlight_. The shape of the highlight is
    determined by [highlightShape]. If it is a [BoxShape.circle], the
    default, then the highlight is a circle of fixed size centered in the
    [InkResponse]. If it is [BoxShape.rectangle], then the highlight is a box
    the size of the [InkResponse] itself, unless [getRectCallback] is
    provided, in which case that callback defines the rectangle. The color of
    the highlight is set by [highlightColor].

  * Simultaneously, it starts to animate a _splash_. This is a growing circle
    initially centered on the tap location. If this is a [containedInkWell],
    the splash grows to the [radius] while remaining centered at the tap
    location. Otherwise, the splash migrates to the center of the box as it
    grows.

 The following two diagrams show how [InkResponse] looks when tapped if the
 [highlightShape] is [BoxShape.circle] (the default) and [containedInkWell]
 is false (also the default).

 The first diagram shows how it looks if the [InkResponse] is relatively
 large:

 ![The highlight is a disc centered in the box, smaller than the child widget.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_response_large.png)

 The second diagram shows how it looks if the [InkResponse] is small:

 ![The highlight is a disc overflowing the box, centered on the child.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_response_small.png)

 The main thing to notice from these diagrams is that the splashes happily
 exceed the bounds of the widget (because [containedInkWell] is false).

 The following diagram shows the effect when the [InkResponse] has a
 [highlightShape] of [BoxShape.rectangle] with [containedInkWell] set to
 true. These are the values used by [InkWell].

 The [InkResponse] widget must have a [Material] widget as an ancestor. The
 [Material] widget is where the ink reactions are actually painted. This
 matches the material design premise wherein the [Material] is what is
 actually reacting to touches by spreading ink.

 If a Widget uses this class directly, it should include the following line
 at the top of its build function to call [debugCheckHasMaterial]:

 ```dart
 assert(debugCheckHasMaterial(context));
 ```

 ## Troubleshooting

 ### The ink splashes aren't visible!

 If there is an opaque graphic, e.g. painted using a [Container], [Image], or
 [DecoratedBox], between the [Material] widget and the [InkResponse] widget,
 then the splash won't be visible because it will be under the opaque graphic.
 This is because ink splashes draw on the underlying [Material] itself, as
 if the ink was spreading inside the material.

 The [Ink] widget can be used as a replacement for [Image], [Container], or
 [DecoratedBox] to ensure that the image or decoration also paints in the
 [Material] itself, below the ink.

 If this is not possible for some reason, e.g. because you are using an
 opaque [CustomPaint] widget, alternatively consider using a second
 [Material] above the opaque widget but below the [InkResponse] (as an
 ancestor to the ink response). The [MaterialType.transparency] material
 kind can be used for this purpose.

  * [GestureDetector], for listening for gestures without ink splashes.
  * [RaisedButton] and [FlatButton], two kinds of buttons in material design.
  * [IconButton], which combines [InkResponse] with an [Icon].
